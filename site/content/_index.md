    powerpoint pricing presentations. When both customers and SaaS providers are
    engaged in a deal, they need some better tools to communicate, collaborate
    and negotiate the deal. The
intro:
  heading: What we offer
  text: "Aprico is the ultimate tool for your AEs to communicate with your
    customers on the deal, all the usage drivers (applications, marketing
    campaigns, incidents etc) and their usage patterns (weekly, daily, spiky
    etc). The tool offers high level summary for the deal amount, with detailed
    drill down to individual resource usage per fine grain time intervals.
    Customers can edit the deal constructs with detailed  feedback to the AEs
    and request specific discounts with comments. "

  heading: Our values
  text: Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too –
    one of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives.
    We want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
